                <h2>About</h2>

                <p>I am a full stack software developer living in Columbus, Ohio. I have experience in both front- and back-end web development and application security. When I'm not staring at a computer screen, I enjoy camping, rock climbing, running, biking, ultimate frisbee, traveling, gardening, and cooking.</p>

                <p>I have spent most of my career doing full stack web development, but have also had jobs in application security engineering and iOS and Android mobile development. I learned a lot of computer science theory and some practical applications through my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science & Engineering at The Ohio State University. I have experience with Ruby on Rails, Python, Node.js, Elixir, Angular, React, and many more programming languages, libraries and frameworks. I have taken coursework in areas as diverse as machine learning, systems programming, algorithm design and analysis, databases, networking, and parallel computing.</p>

                <p>I also like helping my teams implement process improvements to increase code quality and maintainability, security, and time to market. I enjoy learning new areas of computer science and software development and I'm always up for a challenge!</p>

                <h2>Career History</h2>

                <p><em>From 2021-2024</em>, I was a <strong>Full Stack Software Engineer</strong> at <a href="https://www.immuta.com">Immuta</a> in Columbus, Ohio. I spent the start of my time here working on the identity and access management and documentation site Python (Flask) apps with Angular frontends. I then spent the majority of my time working on Node.js / Angular apps to improve customer monitoring of data platform usage and to improve the customer onboarding and scaling experience.</p>

                <p><em>From 2017 - 2021</em>, I was a <strong>Software Developer</strong> and <strong>Application Security Engineer</strong> at <a href="https://www.covermymeds.com">CoverMyMeds</a> in Columbus, Ohio. I worked on application design, development, and support and on improving the security posture of our product offerings. I primarily worked with Ruby on Rails and Phoenix (Elixir) but also dabbled in Python and various frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, Backbone, and Vue.</p>

                <p><em>From 2016 - 2017</em>, I was an <strong>Associate Developer</strong> at <a href="https://www.onenorth.com">One North Interactive</a> in Chicago. I was part of an apprenticeship program that gave me an introduction to One North and its procedures and projects. I was lucky enough to gain exposure to Sitecore, WordPress, KeystoneJS, and various other technologies. My responsibilities included learning as much as I could absorb, contributing to ongoing bugfixes and new features, and supporting client teams. At this job, I worked on projects for some of the biggest law and consulting firms in the country.</p>

                <p><em>In May 2016</em>, I graduated with a <strong>Bachelors of Science in Computer Science & Engineering</strong> from <a href="https://www.osu.edu">The Ohio State University</a>. My Computer Science degree included both a wide variety and depth of material. I took courses in software design and development, algorithms, low-level computer systems, databases, networking, machine learning, electrical engineering, robot design and development, mathematics, statistics, and an intensive, client-facing capstone design and implementation class. While at OSU, I also received a minor in Spanish. To support my language learning, I studied abroad for a semester at the <a href="https://www.ugr.es/en/services/clm">Center of Modern Languages at the University of Granada</a> in Granada, Spain</p>

                <p><em>During Summer 2015</em>, I was an <strong>Applications Developer Intern</strong> at <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com">JP Morgan Chase & Co.</a> in Columbus, Ohio. During my internship, I created a release management tool to expedite the software release process for the Chase Auto Finance team. I also had several side projects that allowed me to learn and apply software security principles in order to increase application security.</p>

                <p><em>During Summer 2014</em>, I was as an <strong>Information Technology Intern</strong> at <a href="https://www.humana.com">Humana Health Insurance</a> in Louisville, Kentucky. While at Humana, I developed an internal, responsive Sharepoint-based web portal as part of a $15 million company-wide initiative to decrease redundancy across lines of business. I also developed a QlikView data visualization application.</p>

                <p><em>From 2013 - 2014</em>, I worked as a <strong>Software Developer</strong> for DXY Solutions, a mobile app consultancy which unfortunately no longer exists, in Cleveland, Ohio. I started as a summer intern and I enjoyed my time there so much that I worked remotely as a Software Developer during parts of my sophomore and junior years of college. During my time at DXY, I worked on the company's website and on various iOS and Android apps. The majority of my time was spent contributing to the company's portion of the <a href="https://curatescape.org">Curatescape</a> line of iPhone and Android history tour apps. These include Cleveland Historical, Spokane Historical, Explore Champaign-Urbana, and dozens more.</p>
